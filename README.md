There seems to be a negative relationship between obesity and income. The higher grades of obesity come with the lower income. This is clear for the states of Arkansas (41,262  35.9), West Virginia (41,059  35.7) and Mississippi (39,680  35.5).

For lower levels of obesity the trend continues to be negative however it is not true for all of the points.

The higher levels of obesity for the highest income are for the states of Alaska (71,583  29.7) and Maryland (73,971  29.6) compared to the lowest obesity and the highest income showed in Washington D.C. (71,648  21.7). 

A further research on the causes of obesity is required in order to explain this behavior of the data. Possible reasons are food quality, less access and possibilities to exercise and general lifestyle. A correlation test should be done in order to determine the degree of statistical relationship between these two variables.
